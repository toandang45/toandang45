Hey there! 👋

I'm **Toan Dang Quoc**, a Python developer based in **Vietnam** 🇻🇳

I build backend and data-driven applications with Python.  
With a background in **Data Science** and experience as both a **Software Engineer** and **Network Engineer**,  
I'm currently moving toward the **Data Engineer** path.

My main tech stack includes **Python, SQL, Django, FastAPI, Flask**, and **Selenium**.

I've got several pinned projects, but my favorite one is **Tesla Stock Forecasting**,  
where I work on time-series analysis and stock price prediction.

**Fun facts:**
- ☕ I love coffee and drink a cup every morning  
- 🧑‍💻 Switched from software to network engineering despite a data science background  
- ⚽ Hobbies: football, coding, and following global news
